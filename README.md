# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple web application that mimics the functionality of the classic toy, Etch A Sketch. Users can draw simple line drawings on a gray canvas by using the arrow keys to move the cursor and pressing the space bar to shake the canvas and start over.

## How to Use
To draw on canvas, you select one of the three grid sizes to populate the grid in etch-a-sketch by clicking on the buttons: small, medium, or large. After the grid populates you simply drag your mouse over the empty squares and begin to draw. If you wish to reset the grid you click on the grey reset button.
